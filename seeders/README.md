## Workout Tracker

For this assignment, I created a workout tracker. I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story

- A user will be able to view create and track daily workouts. They will be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They will also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they should be able to track my distance traveled.
